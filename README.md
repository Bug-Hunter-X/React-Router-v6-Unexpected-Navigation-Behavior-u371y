# React Router v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected behavior during navigation.  The bug might involve pages not rendering properly, incorrect URL display, or issues with route matching, particularly in scenarios with nested routes or dynamic segments.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explanations.  The primary issue often stems from improper route configuration or missing elements like `<BrowserRouter>` or incorrect usage of `useParams` or other hooks.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the unexpected navigation behavior when interacting with the application's links or routes.

## Solution:

The `AppSolution.js` file presents the corrected code, addressing common causes such as missing route elements, typos in the paths or incorrect usage of React Router components. The fix will depend on the specific manifestation of the bug.
